* Your Career Choices
As you have undoubtedly already figured out, Chemical Engineering is a demanding major. Your courses will prepare you to solve complex technical problems of importance to society, to do so ethically, to work in teams, and to communicate effectively.  Those skills can take your career in an almost unlimited number of directions. This course is designed to expose you to some of those many options and to provide some of the professional skills needed to pursue them. Specifically, the learning goals of this 1 credit course are:

1. to be exposed to chemical engineering career options, through interactions with alumni who have preceeded you in this journey
2. to begin to discern options that are appealling to you
3. to develop  professional networking and presentation skills that will help get you where you want to go

* Format
The course will be conducted in person in 136 DBRT.  Weeks 1-2 will focus on professional skill development. Weeks 3-14 will involve a series of virtual panel discussions with alumni of the department. Each panel will focus on one sector, such as pharmaceuticals, energy, foods, personal care, \ldots. A group of students (you!) will introduce the topic and interview the visitors. Each of you will have a chance to participate in one of the panels.
