\section{Your Career Choices}
\label{sec:org85e840a}
As you have undoubtedly already figured out, Chemical Engineering is a demanding major. Your courses will prepare you to solve complex technical problems, to work in teams, and to communicate effectively.  Those skills can take your career in many different directions. This course is designed to expose you to some of those many options and to provide some of the professional skills needed to pursue them. Specifically, the learning goals of this 1 credit course are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item to be exposed to chemical engineering career options, through interactions with alumni who have preceeded you in this journey
\item to begin to discern options that are appealling to you
\item to develop  professional networking and presentation skills that will help get you where you want to go
\end{enumerate}

\section{Format}

Weeks 1-3 will focus on professional skill development. Weeks 4-14 will involve a series of virtual panel discussions with alumni of the department. Each panel will focus on one sector, such as pharmaceuticals, energy, foods, personal care, \ldots.  A group of students will introduce the topic and interview the visitors.
