* Your Career Choices
As you have undoubtedly already figured out, Chemical Engineering is a demanding major. Your courses will prepare you to solve complex technical problems, to work in teams, and to communicate effectively.  Those skills can take your career in many different directions. This course is designed to expose you to some of those many options and to provide some of the professional skills needed to pursue them. Specifically, the learning goals of this 1 credit course are:

1. to be exposed to chemical engineering career options, through interactions with alumni who have preceeded you in this journey
2. to begin to discern options that are appealling to you
3. to develop  professional networking and presentation skills that will help get you where you want to go

* Format
The course will be delivered virtually. We will use the same [[https://notredame.zoom.us/j/91572218330?pwd=WFFvRW9DU3UvMHhXUTBwQUNIZzd0dz09][Zoom link]] throughout the semester.

Weeks 1-3 will focus on professional skill development. Weeks 4-14 will involve a series of virtual panel discussions with alumni of the department.
